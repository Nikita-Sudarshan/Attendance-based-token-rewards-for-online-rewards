Attendance Token Reward System

## Project Description
The Attendance Token Reward System is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that incentivizes student participation in online classes. By recording attendance, students earn tokens that can be used for various rewards, promoting engagement and accountability in the learning process.

## Contract Address
0x546CbB9f5fe50C8032289CbCa00fb35c5bfD8514

## Project Vision
The vision of the Attendance Token Reward System is to create a transparent and engaging learning environment where students are rewarded for their participation. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to enhance accountability and provide a secure method for tracking attendance and rewarding students.

## Key Features
- **Token Rewards**: Students earn tokens for attending classes, which can be redeemed for various rewards.
- **Attendance Tracking**: The smart contract securely records attendance, ensuring that each student can only earn tokens once per class.
- **Decentralization**: Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the system is transparent and resistant to tampering.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive frontend allows students to easily record attendance and check their token balance.
- **Event Logging**: All attendance records and token issuances are logged on the blockchain, providing a clear audit trail.

## Future Improvements
- **Token Trading and Staking**: Allow students to trade or stake their tokens to earn more rewards or participate in governance decisions.
- **Integration with Learning Platforms**: Integration with online learning platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, or proprietary LMS systems to automatically track attendance.
- **Student Verification**: Implement a system where studentsâ€™ identities are verified, possibly using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) or oracles to link their wallet addresses to their real-world identity.
- **Scalability and Gas Fee Reduction**: Optimize the contract to reduce transaction costs, especially if the system scales to large numbers of students.
- **Mobile App Integration**: A mobile app where students can easily view their attendance and token balance, and interact with the smart contract seamlessly.
- **Advanced Reward System**: Implement more advanced token rewards based on class performance, such as receiving more tokens for active participation, or for completing additional assignments or quizzes.
